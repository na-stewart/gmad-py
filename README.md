<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

gmad-py was created to allow for you to easily extract or create multiple addons at one time with any operating system.
Currently, the most popular option, "Gmad - Easy Addon Extractor" only works with Windows and cannot create addons.
This repo has been reinstated and updated due to public demand.
